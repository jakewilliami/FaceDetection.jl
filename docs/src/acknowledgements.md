# Acknowledgements

Thank you to:

 - [**Simon Honberg**](https://github.com/Simon-Hohberg) for the original open-source Python code upon which this repository is largely based.  This has provided me with an easy-to-read and clear foundation for the Julia implementation of this algorithm;
 - [**Michael Jones**](https://www.merl.com/people/mjones) for (along with [Tirta Susilo](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/tirta.susilo)) suggesting the method for a *facelike-ness* measure;
 - [**Mahdi Rezaei**](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/staff/9408/dr-mahdi-rezaei) for helping me understand the full process of Viola-Jones' object detection;
 - [**Ying Bi**](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Main/GradYingBi) for always being happy to answer questions (which mainly turned out to be a lack of programming knowledge rather than conceptual; also with help from [**Bing Xue**](https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~xuebing/index.html));
 - **Mr. H. Lockwood** and **Mr. D. Peck** are Comp. Sci. students who have answered a few questions of mine;
 - Finally, the people in the Julia slack channel, for dealing with many (probably stupid) questions.  Just a few who come to mind: Micket, David Sanders, Eric Forgy, Jakob Nissen, and Roel.
